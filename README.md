**Assignment 1**

The objective of this assignment is to have hands on experience of Git Workflow. You are required to create or fork a repo on Git and use Git bash on the desktop for completing the tasks. You are required to create one manager role for the repository and others as collaborators. The manager will act as a reviewer and decision maker.

**Checklist of the tasks that are required to be performed:**

 - [ ] Do a force push and then later reset the changes
 - [ ] Stage “development branch to production branch”
 - [ ] Showcase how features are released in versions (merging production to master branch)
 - [ ] Also, state importance of Readme and gitignore files and their usage while working in a distributed environment.
 - [ ] Bonus point: If Pull Requests are linked with e-mail to the manager who finally approves the changes.
